        <h1>World Population Report from 1970 to 2020</h1>
        <p>Since 1970, with economic development, people's material needs have been well supplied and the population around the world has been increasing.
          </p>
        <p>
          This World Population Report uses data on the population for each decade from 1970 to 2020 to show visually a map of the world's population 
           distribution, the proportions and changes in the population ratios of different continents from 1970 to 2020, the changes in the population growth rates
            of the top 8 countries in terms of total population, and the two factors affecting the population compared to the population. This report aims to
             provide more visual information for those interested in population change.

        <p>The map mainly shows the number of people per square kilometer 
          in each country in the world. The color value is a channel, the 
          darker the color, the more people per square kilometer in that country.</p>
        <p>In the 1970s, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Poland and Netherland in Europe, and Japan,
           Korea, India and Bangladesh in Asia were more densely populated.</p>

          Nigeria in Africa and Cuba and Mexico in South America were also gradually 
          increasing to over 100 people per square kilometer. Specially, population 
          per square kilometer in India reached 322.31.</p>
        <p>Finally, Indonesia, the Philippines and Nepal in Asia, Uganda, Ethiopia, 
          and Egypt in Africa, and Austria in Europe also have more than one hundred people

        <p> share rose from the 1970s to the beginning of the 20th century, before declining. Europe was
           the second most populous continent in 1970, but its share continued to decline and was surpassed in 
           2000 by Africa, which continued to grow in population. The populations of both South and North America 
           are slowly growing, and Oceania's population growth trend is fast, but its population base is so 
           small that it always is the smallest part of the total population.</p>
