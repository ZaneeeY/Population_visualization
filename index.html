        <h1>World Population Report from 1970 to 2020</h1>
        <p>Since <strong>1970</strong>, with economic development, people's material needs have been well supplied and the population around the world has been increasing.
          </p>
        <p>
          This <strong>World Population Report</strong> uses data on the population for <strong>each decade from 1970 to 2020 </strong>to show visually a map of the world's population 
           distribution, the proportions and changes in the population ratios of different continents from 1970 to 2020, the changes in the population growth rates
            of the top 8 countries in terms of total population, and the two factors affecting the population compared to the population. This report aims to
             provide more visual information for those interested in population change.

        <h2>Influence Factors</h2>
        <p>There are many factors that affect the total population, and this section examines the effects of two factors,
          area and GDP.</p>

        <h3>Area</h3>

      <div class="pure-u-1-2">
        <div class="description description-left">
          <p>Firstly, this section will discuss the <strong>relationship of area and population</strong>. The scatter plot below shows the population
              versus land area for all countries. By choosing a focus year and a focus continent, we can see the relevant data for a specific year and continent.</p>
          <p>The points on the graph are roughly on a rising line,</p>

             In 2020, <span class = "Asia">China</span>, the most populous country, will have an area of more than 9.7 million square kilometers, and <span class = "Europe">Russia</span>, the largest country, will have a population 
             of more than 100 million, while <span class="Europe">Vatican City</span>, the smallest, will have a population of only 520.</p>

      <div class="pure-u-1-2">
        <div class="description description-left">
          <p>Finally, the <strong>relationship between GDP and population</strong> is shown. Below is a scatter plot of the relationship between population and GDP. Again, we can display specific
             data by selecting focused year and focused continent.</p>

             In particular, <span class="Asia">China</span>, the most populous country, has the second highest GDP in the world, <span class="NorthAmerica">the United States</span> with the highest GDP, has a population of over 100 million in 2020, and Tuvalu, the lowest population, has a GDP of only $40 million.</p>
